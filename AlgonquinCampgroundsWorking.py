# Program Purpose: to conduct a site suitability analysis for a campground in Algonquin Provincial Park along the highway 60 corridor

# Program Structure: 

# Assumptions made: This program assumes that the user is only looking to book a campground along the Highway 60 corridor of Algonquin
# Provincial Park in Ontario. It also assumes that elevation and ground level are not a factor, given these are established campgrounds
# It also assumes that the user does not want group camping. We are assuming accuracy of data from Ontario Geohub and the Algonquin
# Park main website. 

# Planned for limitations: 

# Inputs and outputs: Input data will be _____, the campsites that fit the suitability criteria will be written to a csv file
